/*This method can be useful when you have a lot of images on your server and need to transfer the website to another host. Instead of changing the path for each image, you can do the following:
Create a config.php file, that holds the path to your images:*/
<?php
$host = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
$image_path = $host.'/images/';
?>

//Use the config.php file in your scripts:
<?php
require 'config.php';
echo '<img src="'.$image_path.'header.png" />';
?>
