Start a PHP Session

A session is started using the session_start() function.
Use the PHP global $_SESSION to set session variables.
<?php
// Start the session
session_start();

$_SESSION['color'] = "red";
$_SESSION['name'] = "John";
?>

Now, the color and name session variables are accessible on multiple pages, throughout the entire session.
The session_start() function must be the very first thing in your document. Before any HTML tags.

Session Variables

Another page can be created that can access the session variables we set in the previous page:
<?php
// Start the session
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<?php
echo "Your name is " . $_SESSION['name'];
// Outputs "Your name is John"
?>
</body>
</html>

Your session variables remain available in the $_SESSION superglobal until you close your session.
All global session variables can be removed manually by using session_unset(). You can also destroy the session with session_destroy().
