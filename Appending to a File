If you want to append content to a file, you need to open the file in append mode.

For example:
$myFile = "test.txt";
$fh = fopen($myFile, 'a');
fwrite($fh, "Some text");
fclose($fh);

When appending to a file using the 'a' mode, the file pointer is placed at the end of the file, 
ensuring that all new data is added at the end of the file.



Appending to a File

Let's create an example of a form that adds filled-in data to a file.
<?php
if(isset($_POST['text'])) {
  $name = $_POST['text'];
  $handle = fopen('names.txt', 'a');
  fwrite($handle, $name."\n");
  fclose($handle); 
}
?>
<form method="post">
  Name: <input type="text" name="text" /> 
  <input type="submit" name="submit" />
</form>

Now, each time a name is entered and submitted, it's added to the "names.txt" file, along with a new line.

The isset() function determined whether the form had been submitted, as well as whether the text contained a value.
We did not specify an action attribute for the form, so it will submit to itself.
